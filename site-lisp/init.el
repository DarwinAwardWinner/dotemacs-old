;;; Here is my .emacs setup.  It has grown over a period of a few
;;; years.  It allows you to keep an elisp tree in version control,
;;; and makes it easy to try out new packages from time to time.
;;;
;;; There is one configurable variable, init-path.  I happen to put
;;; my elisp tree in ~/elisp.

(defvar init-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp"))

;;; This file, init.el, goes in ~/elisp.  That way, the entire
;;; contents of your .emacs file can be:
;;;
;;; (load-file "~/elisp/init.el")
;;;
;;; If you use xemacs, put that line in ~/.xemacs/init.el
;;;
;;; If you want to use a different directory, you can do something
;;; along these lines:
;;;
;;; (setq init-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs"))
;;; (load-file (expand-file-name "init.el" init-path))
;;;
;;; Since the definition of init-path above is with a defvar, this
;;; file doesn't need to change, even if you want it in a different
;;; path.  Setting init-path in your .emacs file will override the
;;; value above.


;;; Now, on to the features of this setup.
;;;
;;; 1) Any directory with an .el file below ~/elisp will be added to
;;; your load-path at start, or any time you run
;;; add-init-path-to-load-path.
;;;
;;; 2) Any *-settings.el files under ~/elisp/settings will be loaded
;;; automatically on start.
;;;
;;; 3) All .el files under ~/elisp/packages will be byte-compiled if
;;; you run byte-recompile-init-path.


;;; This leads to an easy usage pattern.  Any time you get some elisp
;;; from someone else, drop it into the ~/elisp/packages tree.  I tend
;;; to put single files directly in ~/elisp/packages and multi-file
;;; packages in their own subdirectories.

;;; Any time you want to configure a package, either use M-x configure
;;; or create a small settings file for that package in
;;; ~/elisp/settings.

;;; For optimal results, keep the whole tree in a version control
;;; system.  That also makes it easy to use it from several different
;;; computers.

;;; Hopefully you'll never have to look at this file again!
