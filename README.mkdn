# My Emacs config

This is the contents of my `~/.emacs.d`. Note that there is no
`~/.emacs` file. Everything is inside the `.emacs.d` directory.

## Init

First, there are a couple of init files. First, `init.el`, which just
loads `site-lisp/init.el`. This file is my main initialization file. I
copied it from somewhere on the web and have since modified it
heavily, but I guess it dodn't come with the URL in the file, and I
can't find it anymore. If you recognize it, please tell me.

The third init file, which is loaded from the second, is
`site-lisp/el-get-init.el`, which is designed to bootstrap the
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) package manager (though it
uses my own [fork](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/el-get), where
has some additional features that I need.) This file contains a
definition of all the other elisp packages that I want installed, and
uses el-get to install them. Each package installed by el-get
(including el-get itself) is placed in a named subdirectory in
`site-lisp/el-get/`.

## Settings

In `site-lisp/settings/`, you will find a number of files ending in
`-settings.el`. These are all settings files that both load the
packages that I use and customize them to my liking.

Note also that `site-lisp/custom.el` contains all the variables that I
have set through `M-x customize`. Many of my settings files simply
load a package and contain a commend directing you to edit the
settings via the Custom interface.
